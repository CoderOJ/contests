only interesting problem in this contest

There are 3 states for each node:
	+ always choose it
	+ never choose it
	+ choose it in time [l,r] (either l=0 or r=\inf)

this can be represented in O(1) by delta (but still need to modify interval)

this time we should merge one node to its sons. (of course first shift it)
not possible (dsu on tree?)

that's offline (but i think it can work)

dsu on tree.... i haven't write it before

first, a chain

functional STree and query prefix sums?
great! offline in this subtask

DS:
	+ shift 1 (right or left)
	+ access 
-> Array with shift_when_access (global shift variable)

s**t, modify interval
s**t, now i should use STree with shift
